# Applied software and the corresponding console commands
## basecalling 
-guppy basecaller

The first step for each sequencing run is to basecall your data, i.e., produce fastq sequencing files from the initial fast5 files. We will use the standard basecaller is guppy developed by Oxford Nanopore.

```shell
$ guppy_basecaller -i /input_directory_fast5 -s /output_directory -c <configuration_filge.cfg> [options]
```
The command above will call guppy on the input fast5 directory option (-i), write the output to the directory given with option -s in fastq format (option -o). The configuration file comprises the used nanopore device and the corresponding kit


## Adapter Removal
-Porechop

Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads. Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads

```shell
$ porechop -i <fastq_output_guppy.fastq> -o <porechopped.fastq> 
```
The above command will use the default values of porechop to search for adapters in the input fastq file, trim the reads and write them to file porechopped.fastq

## Filtering
-NanoFilt

NanoFilt is a python script that can be used to filter reads based on length and quality as well as trimming parts of the sequence

```shell
$ NanoFilt -l 200 -q 7 < <porechopped.fastq> > <nanofiltered.fastq>
```
NanoFilt does not provide options for input or output files. Therefore we will use the two operators > and <

With the option -l 200 we remove all sequences shorter than 200 nucleotides and with -q we filter all reads with a phred quality score lower than 7

## Assembly
-Flye

Flye is a de novo assembler for long-reads. Flye also produces a polished consensus sequence for the assembly which significantly reduces the error rate.

```shell
$ flye --meta --nano-hq <input.fastq> -o /output_dir --genome-size 1m -i 7
```
The above command uses the high-quality polished nanopore reads and assembles the genome. The estimated --genome-size is an obligatory input. The --meta option is for metagenomic approaches. 

## Polishing
-minimap2

Minimap2 is a versatile sequence alignment program that aligns DNA against a reference or draft genome. 

```shell
$ minimap2 -ax map-ont -t 8 <metaflye_assembly.fa> <raw_ont_reads.fasta>
```

The above command uses the raw nanopore reads and maps them to the draft genome generated by flye. The option -ax map-ont sets the default parameters for nanopore reads.


-Racon

Consensus assemblies try to reduce error rates by choosing the most likely sequence of a given assembly and a set of raw reads. Although this does not incorporate the raw signal information of the flow cell to correct individual reads it can significantly improve the quality of an assembly. To improve a draft assembly with racon map the reads that should be used for error correction against the assembly. Use minimap to map the trimmed reads from prac3/nanofilt against the miniasm assembly and subsequently use the filtered reads and the mapping to build the consensus assembly

```shell
$ racon <nanofiltered_reads.fastq> 
```

## Guppy - Translating electrices signal into nucleotides

Required input: fast5 files and the configuration file that sets the basecalling parameters depending on which flowcell and library preparation kit was used to produce the data

```guppy_basecaller -c dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.cfg -x 'auto' --recursive -i <input fast5 dirsctory> -s <output directory>```

R10.4 paper commands: The generated raw Nanopore data were basecalled in super-accurate mode using Guppy v. 5.0.16 with the dna_r9.4.1_450bps_sup.cfg model for R9.4.1 and the dna_r10.4_e8.1_sup.cfg model for R10.4 chemistry

## Porechop - Adapter trimming

The known Nanopore adapters that Porechop looks for are defined in the adapters.py file

Basic adapter trimming: 

```porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -o output_reads.fastq.gz```


## NanoFilt - Read trimming and filtering

NanoFilt to trim and filter MinION reads; NanoFilt does not provide options for input or output files. Therefore we will use the two redirect operators “>” and “<“ to

```NanoFilt –l 500 --headcrop 10 < porechopped.fastq > nanofilt_trimmed.fastq```

R10.4 paper: reads with a lower length than 200 bp and a Phred quality score below 7 and 10 for R9.4.1 and R10.4 reads, respectively

## Flye assembler - de novo assembler

Flye is a de novo assembler for single-molecule sequencing reads, such as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies

```flye --nano-hq inputfile.fa --threads N --meta```

R10.4 Paper: --meta --nano-hq
For Q20 data, use a combination of --nano-hq and --read-error 0.03

## Minimap2 - Mapping / Polishing

Takes the original ONT reads as input and realigns them to the assembly generated by Flye

```minimap2 -ax asm5 ref.fa asm.fa > aln.sam```


## Racon - Error Correction / Polishing 

Provides a fasta consensus algorithm that uses either 2nd generation short reads or raw noisy long-reads to correct draft assemblies

Use minimap2 to map the trimmed nanofilt reads back to the flye assembly and then use the filtered reads and the mapping to build the consensus assembly.

```racon [options ...] <sequences> <overlaps> <target sequences>```

    
sequences: input file in FASTA/FASTQ format (can be compressed with gzip) containing sequences used for correction

overlaps: input file in MHAP/PAF/SAM format (can be compressed with gzip) containing overlaps between sequences and target sequences

target sequences: input file in FASTA/FASTQ format (can be compressed with gzip) containing sequences which will be corrected
